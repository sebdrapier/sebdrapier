# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Sebastien Drapier** (but you can call me Seb), coding from the historic city of **Orléans, France** 🥖🧀.

## 🌟 About Me

- 🚀 **Frontend Developer Extraordinaire**: Crafting snazzy user interfaces with **React**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and a dash of **Tailwind CSS**.
- 🎵 **Musical Maverick**: When I'm not wrangling code, I'm jamming out tunes that make my neighbors question their life choices.
- ☕ **Caffeine Connoisseur**: My code doesn't run on coffee. **I do**.

## 💡 My Philosophy

- **Keep it Simple, Silly (K.I.S.S.)**: Complexity is the enemy.
- **Embrace the Bugs**: They're just features in disguise.
- **TypeScript or Bust**: Because who needs runtime errors?

## 😂 Fun Facts

- 🌱 **Currently Learning**: How to center a div. Just kidding—or am I?
- 💬 **Ask Me About**:
  - How JavaScript promises to make your life easier... and then doesn't.
  - The time I tried to fix a bug for 12 hours before realizing I was in the wrong file.
- 🎧 **Fun Fact**: I once wrote a function so pure, it refused to side-effect.

## ⚡ More Fun Facts

- I use **Tailwind CSS** to make my code look as good as my hair—on a good day.
- Once tried to play music for my plants; they wilted. Coding might be safer.
